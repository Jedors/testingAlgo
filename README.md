Algorithms tests exercises

This project goal is to analyze sample of paper algorithms
and automatically estimate the value, the type of the variables, or if
a parameter is passed by adress or by value.
It also can estimate the code of the procedure or functions.

Sample of algorithm analysable :
A <- 5
B <- A
Print (A) show 5
B <- Toto (A>6, 3, Titi (5, A=B, A)<A, Txtx (A<B))
Print (A) show 6
Tutu (A)
Print (A) show 6
