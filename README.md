Algorithms tests exercises

This project goal is to analyze sample of paper algorithms
and automatically estimate the value, the type of the variables, or if
a parameter is passed by adress or by value.
It also can estimate the code of the procedure or functions.

--Usage
In a console:
  > analysePseudoCode.exe fileName

Sample of algorithm analysable :
A <- 5
B <- A
Affiche (A) donne 5
B <- Toto (A>6, 3, Titi (5, A=B, A)<A, Txtx (A<B))
Affiche (A) donne 6
Tutu (A)
Affiche (A) donne 6
